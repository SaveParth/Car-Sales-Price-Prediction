**Car Sales Price Prediction & Titanic Survival Prediction - README**

**Project Overview**

This repository contains:

Car Sales Price Prediction - Predicting the price of used cars based on various features.
project follows a structured approach involving data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation.

**1. Car Sales Price Prediction**

**Dataset**

The dataset consists of used car sales data with features like brand, year, mileage, engine size, fuel type, etc.

Target variable: Car Price

**Data Preprocessing**

Handling missing values using imputation techniques.

Encoding categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding.

Feature scaling using StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler.

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

**Model Selection**

Various regression models were tested, including:

Decision Tree
Random Forest
XGBoost
Linear Regression
Support Vector Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors

**Tuned models and ensemble techniques:**

Random Forest Regressor (Tuned): R-squared = 0.5686

K-Nearest Neighbors (Tuned): R-squared = 0.5246

Ridge Regression (Tuned): R-squared = 0.6078

Stacking Ensemble: R-squared = 0.6153

Hyperparameter tuning was performed using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.

**Performance Analysis**

Model evaluation metrics used:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R-squared Score (RÂ²)
